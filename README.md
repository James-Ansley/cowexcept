## Install

    pip install cowexcept


## Should you install this?

Probably not!
This is a hastily hacked together project that does not do anything useful.
It also does not do zesty and exciting things like have nicely formatted 3.10 syntax error messages.
But! It might still spice up those error messages and make them a bit less draining to read.

## Usage

All you have to do to get started is `import cowexcept` and then any exceptions whenceforth will be in beautiful cowsay format:

    >>> import cowexcept
    >>> 1 / 0
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "...", line 90, in runcode
        exec(code, self.locals)
      File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
